# Write a "Guess the Number game".
# The player has to guess a random number between 1 and 1000.
# If the guessed number is wrong then the game should give him a hint like:
# "Your number is to low" or
# "Your number is to high".
# The Player must guess until the number is right.
# In the end the game should print the number of the tries needed by the player.
